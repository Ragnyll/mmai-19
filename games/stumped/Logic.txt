	for each of your lodges:

			spawn a builder beaver
		if number of beavers is less than or equal to 8:
			spawn a hungry beaver
		if number of beavers is less than or equal to 10:
			spawn a fighter beaver

					spawn a builder beaver

beaver_act
	for each of your beavers:
		if your beaver is standing on a lodge:
			get off the lodge
			
		if beaver has actions left:
			if your beaver + its tile has adequate wood to construct a lodge:
				if your beaver has moves left:
					if your beaver isn't adjacent to a type of resource:
						move its full move action toward that resource
					construct the lodge
					
			if your beaver is a builder beaver:
				if your beaver is not adjacent to a source of wood:
					resource_path toward that wood with all move actions
					
				if your beaver is currently at carrying capacity:
					if your beaver is adjacent to a source of wood:
						if your beaver is currently standing on water:
							move off the water
						drop the wood it's carrying on its current square
						
				if your beaver is adjacent to a source of wood:
					chop as much wood as possible
					
			if your beaver is a hungry beaver:
				if your beaver is at carrying capacity:
					resource_path toward the the nearest friendly lodge with all move actions
					if your beaver is adjacent to the lodge:
						 drop the food on the lodge's tile
				
				if your beaver is not adjacent to a source of food:
					resource_path toward that food with all move actions
				
				if your beaver is adjacent to a source of food:
					munch as much food as possible
						
			if your beaver is a fighter:
				if your beaver is adjacent to an enemy beaver:
					ATTACK
				try to resource_path toward the nearest enemy lodge
				

resource_path(start point, type of resource)
	use BFS to identify the shortest path toward a specified type of resource
